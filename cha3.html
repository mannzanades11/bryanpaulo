<h2>CREATION OF MULTIMEDIA IMAGES:</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> Images obviously play a very important role in multimedia products.
	Images may be photograph-like bitmaps, vector-based drawings, or 3D renderings..
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> The type of still images created depends on the display resolution, and hardware and software capabilities.
	</p> 
	</li>
	<li> Access to the right tools and right hardware for image development is important!
	E.g., graphic designers like to have large, high-resolution monitors or multiple monitors.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	</ul>

<hr>

<h2>BITMAPS:</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> Bitmap is derived from the words ‘bit’, which means the simplest element in which only two digits are used, and ‘map’, which is a two-dimensional matrix of these bits.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> A bitmap is a data matrix describing the individual dots of an image that are the smallest elements (pixels) of resolution on a computer screen or printer.
	</p> 
	</li>
	<li> Bitmaps are an image format suited for creation of:
	<p>Photo-realistic images.
	<p>Complex drawings.
	<p>Images that require fine detail.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> Bitmapped images are known as paint graphics.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> Bitmapped images can have varying bit and color depths.
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li> More bits provide more color depth, hence more photo-realism; 
	but require more memory and processing power.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> Monochrome just requires one bit per pixel, representing black or white.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> 8 bits per pixel allows 256 distinct colors.
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li> 16 bits per pixel represents 32K distinct colors (Most graphic chipsets now supports the full 65536 colors and the color green uses the extra one bit)
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> 24 bits per pixel allows millions of colors.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> 32 bits per pixel – trillion of colors.
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li> Bitmaps are best for photo-realistic images or complex drawings requiring fine detail.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> Bitmaps picture and their suitability of use:-
	<p>Use the native Microsoft bmp format as a raw image that will later be processed. It faster to process.
	<p>Use JPEG, for photo sharing on the web because of its size and quality.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> GIF is normally used for diagrams, buttons, etc., that have a small number of colours.
	It is also suitable for simple animation because it supports interlaced images. 
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li>  PNG is almost equal to gif except that it didn’t support the animation format.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> Bitmaps can be inserted by:
	<p>Using clip art galleries.
	<p>Using bitmap software.
	<p>Capturing and editing images.
	<p>Scanning images.
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	</ul>

<h2>USING CLIP ART GALLERIES:</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> A clip art gallery is an assortment of graphics, photographs, sound, and video.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> Clip arts are a popular alternative for users who do not want to create their own images.
	</p> 
	</li>
	<li> Clip arts are available on CD-ROMs and on the Internet.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p>LEGAL RIGHTS:
	<p>Public domain image.
	<p>Royalty free image.
	<p>Right Managed Image.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	</ul>

<h2>USING BITMAP SOFTWARE:</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> The industry standard for bitmap painting and editing programs are:
	<p>Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator.
	<p>Macromedia's Fireworks.
	<p>Corel's Painter.
	<p>CorelDraw.
	<p>Quark Express.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	
	</ul>

<h2>CAPTURING AND EDITING IMAGES:</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> Capturing and storing images directly from the screen is another way to assemble images for multimedia.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> The PRINT SCREEN button in Windows and COMMAND-CONTROL-SHIFT-4 keystroke on the Macintosh copies the screen image to the clipboard.
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li> Clipboard : a temporary memory to store the COPY, CUT and PASTE data.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p>Image editing programs enable the user to:
	<p>Enhance and make composite images.
	<p>Alter and distort images.
	<p>Add and delete elements.
	<p>Morph (manipulate still images to create animated transformations).

	</p>
	</li>
	
	</ul>

<hr>

<h2>SCANNING IMAGES:</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> Users can scan images from conventional sources and make necessary alterations and manipulations.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	
	</ul>
