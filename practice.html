“I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure.
 I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle.
 But if you can't handle me at my worst,
 then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.” <br>
-Marilyn Monroe

Love like you'll never be hurt,
Sing like there's nobody listening,
And live like it's heaven on earth.”<br>
