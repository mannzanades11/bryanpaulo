<h1><p>WHAT IS MULTIMEDIA?</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li><p><p>Multimedia is any combination of text, art, sound, animation, and video delivered to you by computer or other electronic or digitally manipulated means.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p><p>It is richly presented sensation. When you weave together the sensual elements of multimedia — dazzling pictures and animations, engaging sounds, compelling video clips, and raw textual information — you can electrify the thought and action centers of people’s minds. When you give them interactive control of the process, they can be enchanted.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><p>DEFINITIONS OF TERMS</h1></p>
<ul> 
	<li> <p>When you allow an end user — also known as the viewer of a multimedia project — to control what and when the elements are delivered, it is called INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> <p>When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes HYPERMEDIA.</p>
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li><p>The people who weave multimedia into meaningful tapestries are called MULTIMEDIA DEVELOPERS.
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p>The software vehicle, the messages, and the content presented on a computer, television screen, PDA (personal digital assistant), or mobile phone together constitute a MULTIMEDIA PROJECT.
	</p> 
	
	</li>
	<li><p>If the project is to be shipped or sold to consumers or end users, typically delivered as a download on the Internet but also on a CD-ROM or DVD in a box or sleeve, with or without instructions, it is a MULTIMEDIA TITLE
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p>BROWSERS – are software programs or tools for viewing content on the Web such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, or Firefox.
	</p>

	<li><p>LINEAR - starting at the beginning and running through to the end of the multimedia project. (Sequential)
	</p> 
	</li>
	
	<li><p>NON-LINEAR - users are given navigational control and can wander through the multimedia content at will. (Random)
